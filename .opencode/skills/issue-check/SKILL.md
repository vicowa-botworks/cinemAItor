name: issue-check
description: Check the project's open GitHub issues and address them one by one — a dedicated feature branch per issue, the full verification gate, a PR driven through the review loop to merge, then a main sync and cleanup of the merged local branch, repeated until the issue queue is empty. Use when the user says "check the issues", "address the issues", "work the issue list", "resolve open issues", or asks to drain the GitHub issue queue.

# Issue Check Loop

Work the project's open GitHub issues end to end without supervision: for each issue, triage it,
implement the fix on its own feature branch, verify, open a PR, drive it through the review loop
to merge, sync main, delete the merged local branch, and move to the next issue. Stop when the
open-issue queue is empty — or stop and report on any hard-stop condition below.

## 0. Setup

1. Get to a clean main:

   ```bash
   git fetch origin && git checkout main && git pull --ff-only && git status --short
   ```

   If the working tree is dirty, stop and report — never start an issue with pending changes.
2. List the open issues (oldest first):

   ```bash
   gh issue list --state open --json number,title,labels,createdAt
   ```

   If none: report "no open issues" and stop.
3. Make a todo list with one entry per issue (plus a final "queue drained" entry) so progress
   survives context loss.
4. If `gh issue view <N>` fails with a `projects (classic)` deprecation error, read issue bodies
   via the REST API instead:

   ```bash
   gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<N> --jq '{title, body, labels: [.labels[].name]}'
   ```

## 1. Per-issue cycle (repeat for each issue, oldest first)

Re-fetch the open-issue list before starting each issue (new issues may have appeared); keep
working oldest first until the list is empty.

### 1.1 Triage

- Read the issue body in full and reproduce/trace it against the current code.
- **Bug that reproduces** → proceed to 1.2.
- **Feature request** → follow the repo's plan-first workflow before coding: draft the plan, add
  the workstream + design section to the master plan, write the implementation contract doc, then
  implement.
- **Invalid / duplicate / not reproducible** → make no branch; post a comment on the issue with
  the reproduction attempt and reasoning, and close it (`gh issue close <N>`) with that comment.
  Mark the todo done and go to the next issue.

### 1.2 Branch + implement

- Cut a branch from current main: `fix/<short-slug>` for bugs, `feature/<short-slug>` for
  features. One issue per branch — never bundle two issues in one branch or PR.
- Implement following the conventions of the surrounding code. In this repo specifically:
  - a new backend route needs its `openApiOps` entry in the same file (spec build throws on
    drift);
  - a new migration gets the next free `NNNN` (re-check after merging main — concurrent PRs claim
    numbers) and must update the expected-filename list **and** the count assertion in
    `backend/tests/migrations.test.ts`;
  - behavior changes are documented in `ARCHITECTURE.md` / `PROJECT_STATE.md` / `docs/*.md`.

### 1.3 Verify

Run the full gate from the repo root and get it green before committing:

```bash
deno task lint && deno task check && deno fmt --check && deno task test
```

Always the tree-walk `deno fmt` form — explicit file paths ignore the project config in this
Deno version and falsely flag clean files.

### 1.4 PR + review loop

- Commit (message naming the issue, e.g. `Fix <thing> (issue #N)`), push, and
  `gh pr create` with `Closes #N` in the body.
- Immediately run the **review-loop** skill on the new PR (CI → team review → merge). It handles
  CI fixes, conflict resolution (merge `origin/main` into the branch, never rebase), reviewer
  feedback (verify every claim against the source before changing code), and the merge gate.

### 1.5 Post-merge cleanup

```bash
git checkout main && git pull --ff-only && git branch -d <branch>
```

- Branch cleanup is **local only**: `git branch -d` (safe delete — it refuses if unmerged).
  Remote branches are auto-deleted by GitHub on merge; never `git push origin --delete`.
- Mark the todo done, report a one-line status (issue, PR number, merged), and go to the next
  issue.

## 2. Hard rules

- One issue = one branch = one PR. No bundling.
- Never force-push or rebase in-flight PR branches; resolve conflicts by merging `origin/main`,
  re-run the gate, push, re-request review.
- Never merge a PR that is not approved with green checks (the review-loop skill enforces this).
- If the review loop hits a hard stop (1-hour poll budget exhausted, >5 fix iterations, recurring
  CI failure, merge blocked), stop the loop and report the PR URL and the failing output — do not
  silently move on to the next issue with one left dangling.
- A dirty working tree at the start of an iteration is a stop-and-report condition.
- Keep the user informed: one short line per issue at triage, PR creation, merge, and cleanup;
  a final summary when the queue is drained (issues closed, PRs merged, branches cleaned up).
